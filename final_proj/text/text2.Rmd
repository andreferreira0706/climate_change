<center> The graph depicts data from an experiment by Vanderbilt University's Latin
American Public Opinion Project conducted in 2017. It shows that climate change
is a partisan issue in the US. While more than three-quarters of individuals on
the liberal side of the political spectrum reported that climate change is a very
serious problem, less than 20% of those with conservative leanings expressed the 
same degree of concern. Ideally, any individual, no matter their political 
affiliation, should recognize the grave concern that is our changing climate, and 
believe it to pose a very serious problem. </center>
