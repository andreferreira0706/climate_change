<center> The most concerning statistic is that the United States continues to be one of the
largest and most significant emitters of carbon dioxide emissions. The US is only 
second to China in having the largest national share of CO2 emissions at nearly 15
percent of the global total, and it is the country with the highest cumulative CO2 
emissions value. Despite the divisiveness of US public opinion surrounding the severity 
of climate change and the role of human activity in worsening its effect, there is 
no denying the United States' role in growing carbon emissions. Federal, state, and 
local governments have all debated climate change policies, but have failed to implement
emission regulations that significantly reduce the nation's carbon footprint as a result
of polarization in opinion. </center>
