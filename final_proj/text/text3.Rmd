<center> It is a truly concerning statistic that only 44% of the US public believes 
climate change to be a very serious threat. Unfortunately, this data is 
evidence that there still exist individuals that don't believe the science. It 
is now more important than ever that world leaders make well-informed decisions
and mobilize support against the environmental crisis we now face, but instead,
we are caught fighting over whether to believe the scientific conclusions drawn
by climate experts. The overwhelming evidence regarding the effect of increased
greenhouse gas emissions should push government officials to adopt necessary 
measures to tackle this complex issue, yet conflicting beliefs surrounding the 
reality of climate change has left climate policy at a standstill. </center>
