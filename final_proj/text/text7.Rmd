Despite current climate policies to reduce carbon emissions, international targets
are not being reached fast enough. The graphs above show that over the years, there
has been an uptick in CO2 concentrations in every continent (besides Antarctica due
to insufficient data), some more drastic than others. The question that many scientists
and political officials are asking is whether we can make progress fast enough? Is it 
possible for countries to successfully reduce emissions whilst building their economies? 

I encourage you to see whether countries of your own interest meet this criteria! There 
certainly exists some countries who have shown progress in reducing emissions, as well as 
increasing their GDP. These examples, such as Portugal, the UK, and France, makes it clear 
that it is possible to transition to low-carbon alternatives while boosting one's economy.
